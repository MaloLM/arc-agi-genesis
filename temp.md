## Requirements

You only need `Python 3` and `pip` for Linux, macOS, or Windows.

## Project Structure and Setup

After cloning the repository, youâ€™ll access:

- **`challenges_plotting.ipynb`**: Visualizes ARC challenges with various graphical methods.
- **`challenges_sorting.ipynb`**: Optimizes task execution order during evaluations.
- **`tiny_arc.ipynb`**: Focuses on solving smaller, simpler tasks before scaling to larger ones.
- **`kaggle_submission.ipynb`**: Prepares solutions for submission using external package imports.
- **`self_sufficient_kaggle_submission.ipynb`**: Offers a self-contained submission method.
- **`local_benchmark.ipynb`**: Benchmarks your solutions locally.

## Kaggle Submission

Kaggle requires notebook submissions for evaluation. You can submit in two ways:

### 1. By Importing an External Package
This approach separates the solution and evaluation for cleaner development. Refer to `/source/kaggle_submission.ipynb`.

### 2. Using a Self-Sufficient Notebook
A quicker, all-in-one solution without external imports. Refer to `self_sufficient_kaggle_submission.ipynb`.
